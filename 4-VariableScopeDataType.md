## variable in C++
A variable hold data.
In C++ we primially have five variable.

1. int- 1, 44, -3
2. float- it stores the decimal values
3. character - it stores the character like a, f, g
4. Double - more precise than float.
5. bool - it may be True or Flase

## Syntax for deleclring the variable
 int a = 23;

Scope - means where the variable is avaliable(Region where the existance of variable is valid )
 so, 

# Scope of the variable 
1. local - declare inside the braces of any function and can be accessed only from there 
2. Global - declared outside the braces of any function and can be accessed from anywhere

## can global and tye local variable have same name - yessss!!!
## local variable get more precedance over the globle variable

# Data Type -
It is the data that variable can hold.

three groups are there for the variables
1. Build-in - that 5
2. user define - Struct, Union, Enum
3. Derived Data Types -
Array Function pointer

2. the variable name is case sensitive.
3. no space and special chracter is allowed.
